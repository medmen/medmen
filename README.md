- 👋 Hi, I’m @medmen, aging constantly, admirer of the 3 most beautiful girls in my world and in desperate need of a time-warp to get all my interests aligned :)


- 👀 I’m interested in ... whow a lot of things. given enough time among them i like
  - programming in PHP (my home zone), python, R, js, html, css
  - hiking, running, bouldering
  - skiing (including alpine, cross-country and touring), camping, caravaning
  - any kind of metal music as long as it has at least some good melody, groove or message to offer

- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...
  - the hard way that a day is limited to 24 hours, so after subtraction of a minimum of sleep, too much work, family and a bit of social life 
there is virtually no time left for my hobbies :) 

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project that 
  - makes my day flow easier
  - makes my family happy
  - makes me do more with less effort
  - 
- 📫 How to reach me?
  - i am old-school at this point: drop me a personal message and I'll get back to you.
  - follow me @whateverSocialThingIsCoolRightNow and chances are good I will never answer, sorry ;)
